## Welcome to the *D*esign of *M*aterials on *C*omputers Lab 👨‍💻🔋🔬

The DMC Lab is headed by Professor [Chris Bartel](https://cse.umn.edu/cems/chris-bartel) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/).

Our group utilizes first-principles calculations and data-driven approaches to design and discover novel materials for energy conversion and storage applications.

Here we house several open source packages which the group has developed and/or refactored to make our work possible.

For more information related to the group's motivation, philosophy, and current projects, please visit our [group's website](https://bartel.cems.umn.edu/).
